		<p>
			Question 1: <br>
			The API that I selected generates random quotes from the character <br>
			named Ron Swanson in the tv show, "Parks and Rec." This is the most <br>
			beloved and famous character in this class and I thought it would be <br>
			important to make a website that would warm users' days by giving them <br>
			access to random quotes from Ron. 
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			Question 2: <br>
			Citation URL: https://github.com/jamesseanwright/ron-swanson-quotes#ron-swanson-quotes-api
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			Question 3: <br>
			The options that I used for the API call were fetch and get. Both options <br>
			ultimately do the same thing, but go about it in different ways. Using "get", <br>
			creates a request object from the url, opens the request, creates an onreadystatechange <br>
			event to the callback, and then sends the request. Fetch on the other hand, does many of <br>
			same operations, only it streamlines the request by consolidating many of the common <br>
			elements of an XMLHttpRequest. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Question 4: <br>
			Two applications that this API would be useful for would be a "Parks and Rec" fan page and <br>
			and an online, interactive game. For the fan page, I could imagine this API being used to <br>
			populate the website with random Ron Swanson Quotes to appeal to the audience that is visitng <br>
			a "Parks and Rec" fangae website. As far as the interactive, online game - I can visualize a <br>
			gaming website that is similar to a sherades style game where you have to impersonate the character <br>
			of which the quote originates from. This API doesn't have the most important applications, rather it <br>
			is more just for fun.
